/*
The previous exercise is dynamic styling in React Native.

older phones usuallyhave screens with lower precision or pixels per inch.
which means fewer pixels to control. when using older devices, our content
might get cut off or not display properly.


// burger example with fixed dimensions:

<Image
 source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/burger.png' }}
 style={{ width: 320, height: 320 }}
/>

//we can also use percentage values for width and height to make our content
// here is the burger exmaple with percentage dimensions:


<Image
 source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/burger.png' }}
 style={{ width: '50%', height: '50%' }}
/>
