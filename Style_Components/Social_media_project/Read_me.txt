unfortunately i had to stop the project becausea the learning program was running int
into an issue and the expo snak was not cooperating either. 

I could use expogo to make this easier, but the problem isthe programs
expo go is set for SDK 53 but my phone is updated to SDK 54

I could use a ios simulator but that is too difficult for this intial learning expereince
so what we have is what we have

i may return to this at a later point, for now we are done.

oh the issue i forgot to mention that i was encountering is that  
the website module was not updating properly with the changes i made
so the only way to see these changes was to update the background color
constanly and I did not want to d this repeatly.
